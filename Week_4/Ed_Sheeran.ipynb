He was born in Halifax, before moving to Framlingham. He learned to play guitar and started writing songs at a young age. He began recording in 2005 and moved to London in 2008 to pursue a music career. In 2009, he played 312 gigs. In early 2011, Sheeran released an independent extended play, No. 5 Collaborations Project which led him to be signed to Asylum / Atlantic Records. Buoyed by the commercial breakthrough of the singles &quot;The A Team&quot; and &quot;Lego House&quot;, his debut album + has been certified quintuple platinum in the United Kingdom. In 2012, he won two BRIT Awards for Best British Male Solo Artist, and British Breakthrough of the Year, while &quot;The A Team&quot; also won the Ivor Novello Award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically. After collaborating with Taylor Swift on a track for her album Red (2012), it was announced that Sheeran will appear as a special guest on Swift&#039;s seven-month Red Tour of North America in 2013. Ed Sheeran has also toured with, and performed solo, as the opening band for the Rolling Stones on their Zip Code tour in 2015.</p>\n",
